# gyro_accel_firebase_combo
This repository have been created to a project where is needed to read accel and gyro values and also we want to upload data (real-time data) to Firebase DB.

-- -- -- -- HARDWARE REQUIRED: MPU6050 / GY-521 / ESP8266 & Arduino or NodeMCU -- -- -- 

In this project, the data is send via Wifi to Firebase, but also is saved at the EEPROM memory (in case you use NodeMCU). And so, I also share the "reading data from EEPROM" sketch.
