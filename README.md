# gyro_accel_firebase_combo

*PLEASE CONSIDER THAT I'M JUST STARTING, AND SO, DON'T USE THIS PROGRAMM UNLESS YOU ARE 100% SURE OF IT. YOU ARE THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE. Thx <3* 

This repository have been created to a project where is needed to read accel and gyro values and also we want to upload data (real-time data) to Firebase DB.

-- -- -- -- HARDWARE REQUIRED: MPU6050 / GY-521 / ESP8266 & Arduino or NodeMCU -- -- -- --

In this project, the data is send via Wifi to Firebase, but also is saved at the EEPROM memory (in case you use NodeMCU). And so, I also share the "reading data from EEPROM" sketch.
